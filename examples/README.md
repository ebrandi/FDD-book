## Example Organization

Each example includes:

- **Source code files** (`.c`, `.h`, `.mk`, etc.)
- **Makefile** for building the example
- **README** with specific instructions for that example
- **Documentation** explaining the example's purpose and usage

## Building Examples

### Prerequisites

Before building any examples, ensure you have:

1. **FreeBSD development environment** set up
2. **Kernel source code** available
3. **Required tools** installed:
   - `gcc` or `clang`
   - `make`
   - `kldload`/`kldunload` (for kernel modules)

### Building a Specific Example

```bash
# Navigate to the example directory
cd examples/chapters/part1/example-01

# Build the example
make

# Load the kernel module (if applicable)
sudo kldload ./example_module.ko

# Unload the kernel module (if applicable)
sudo kldunload example_module
```

### Building All Examples

```bash
# From the examples directory
make all
```

## Contributing

If you find issues with any examples or want to contribute improvements:

1. **Test the example** on your FreeBSD system
2. **Document any issues** you encounter
3. **Submit improvements** via pull request
4. **Follow the coding standards** used in the book

## Version Compatibility

These examples are designed for:
- **FreeBSD 14.x** and later
- **x86_64** and **ARM64** architectures
- **GCC** and **Clang** compilers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build errors**: Ensure you have the correct kernel headers installed
2. **Module loading failures**: Check kernel messages with `dmesg`
3. **Permission errors**: Use `sudo` for kernel module operations
4. **Architecture mismatches**: Verify you're building for the correct architecture

### Getting Help

- Check the specific example's README for detailed instructions
- Review the book chapter for theoretical background
- Consult FreeBSD documentation and man pages
- Check kernel messages: `dmesg | tail`
